# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The AI Meeting Platform is a comprehensive solution that enables users to upload meeting videos, automatically transcribe them using AI, and interact with the transcribed content through an intelligent conversation agent. The platform provides client management capabilities, real-time transcription status tracking, and an intuitive interface for reviewing meetings with synchronized video playback and searchable transcriptions.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Client Management System

**User Story:** As a platform administrator, I want to manage a list of clients, so that I can organize meetings by client and track engagement across different accounts.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing the platform THEN the system SHALL display a clients list interface
2. WHEN viewing the clients list THEN the system SHALL show client names, contact information, and meeting count
3. WHEN selecting a client THEN the system SHALL filter meetings to show only that client's meetings
4. WHEN adding a new client THEN the system SHALL validate required fields and save the client information
5. WHEN editing client information THEN the system SHALL update the client record and maintain data integrity

### Requirement 2: Meeting Management and Upload

**User Story:** As a user, I want to upload meeting videos and associate them with clients, so that I can organize and process my meeting recordings systematically.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN uploading a meeting video THEN the system SHALL accept common video formats (MP4, MOV, AVI, WebM)
2. WHEN uploading a video THEN the system SHALL require association with a client from the clients list
3. WHEN a video is uploaded THEN the system SHALL validate file size and format before processing
4. WHEN upload is successful THEN the system SHALL create a meeting record with "pending" status
5. WHEN upload fails THEN the system SHALL display clear error messages to the user

### Requirement 3: Background Transcription Processing

**User Story:** As a user, I want my uploaded meetings to be automatically transcribed in the background, so that I don't have to wait and can continue working while processing occurs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a meeting video is uploaded THEN the system SHALL automatically start a background transcription job
2. WHEN transcription job starts THEN the system SHALL update meeting status to "processing"
3. WHEN transcription is in progress THEN the system SHALL track elapsed time and estimate remaining time based on video length
4. WHEN transcription completes THEN the system SHALL update meeting status to "completed" and store transcription data
5. IF transcription fails THEN the system SHALL update meeting status to "failed" and log error details

### Requirement 4: Meeting Status Tracking and Progress Display

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see the real-time status of my meeting transcriptions, so that I know when they're ready for review and can track processing progress.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing meetings list THEN the system SHALL display current status for each meeting (pending, processing, completed, failed)
2. WHEN a meeting is processing THEN the system SHALL show elapsed time since upload
3. WHEN a meeting is processing THEN the system SHALL display estimated remaining time based on video duration
4. WHEN status changes THEN the system SHALL update the display without requiring page refresh
5. WHEN transcription completes THEN the system SHALL notify the user of completion

### Requirement 5: Meeting Playback Interface

**User Story:** As a user, I want to watch meeting videos with synchronized transcriptions, so that I can review content efficiently and jump to specific moments in the conversation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing a completed meeting THEN the system SHALL display the video player alongside the transcription
2. WHEN transcription text is clicked THEN the system SHALL jump the video to the corresponding timestamp
3. WHEN video plays THEN the system SHALL highlight the current transcription segment being spoken
4. WHEN seeking in the video THEN the system SHALL update the transcription view to match the current position
5. WHEN transcription loads THEN the system SHALL display timestamps for each segment of text

### Requirement 6: Transcription Data Management

**User Story:** As a system, I want to store transcription data with proper timestamps and speaker identification, so that users can navigate and search through meeting content effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN transcription is generated THEN the system SHALL store text segments with precise timestamps
2. WHEN multiple speakers are detected THEN the system SHALL identify and label different speakers
3. WHEN storing transcription THEN the system SHALL maintain the relationship between video position and text content
4. WHEN transcription is complete THEN the system SHALL make the data searchable through the database
5. WHEN displaying transcription THEN the system SHALL format timestamps as clickable links

### Requirement 7: AI Conversation Agent with Search Capabilities

**User Story:** As a user, I want to interact with an AI agent that can search through my meeting transcriptions, so that I can quickly find specific information across all my meetings.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN interacting with the AI agent THEN the system SHALL provide a chat interface for natural language queries
2. WHEN user asks about meeting content THEN the AI agent SHALL use SQL-like search to query transcription database
3. WHEN search results are found THEN the AI agent SHALL provide relevant excerpts with meeting context and timestamps
4. WHEN no results are found THEN the AI agent SHALL inform the user and suggest alternative search terms
5. WHEN AI agent responds THEN the system SHALL include links to jump directly to relevant meeting moments

### Requirement 8: Meeting Filtering and Organization

**User Story:** As a user, I want to filter my meetings by client and other criteria, so that I can quickly find specific meetings or review client-specific content.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing meetings list THEN the system SHALL provide filter options for client, date range, and status
2. WHEN applying client filter THEN the system SHALL show only meetings associated with the selected client
3. WHEN applying date filter THEN the system SHALL show meetings within the specified time range
4. WHEN applying status filter THEN the system SHALL show meetings matching the selected processing status
5. WHEN filters are active THEN the system SHALL clearly indicate which filters are applied and allow easy removal

### Requirement 9: Testing Strategy

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive integration testing coverage, so that the platform functions reliably across all user workflows.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing features THEN the system SHALL use Pest v4 browser testing for all test coverage
2. WHEN testing user workflows THEN the system SHALL use headless browser testing to simulate real user interactions
3. WHEN writing tests THEN the system SHALL NOT include unit tests, focusing exclusively on integration testing
4. WHEN testing file uploads THEN the system SHALL verify end-to-end upload and processing workflows
5. WHEN testing AI agent interactions THEN the system SHALL verify complete conversation flows through browser automation
